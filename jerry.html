                <p>Jerry Alexander was a walk-on at Columbia who at least partially made up for his
                    complete lack of talent
                    with his dogged refusal to accept the reality that he had no business running in Division I. As a
                    senior, Jerry was captain of the Lions Cross Country and Track squads. Jerry used his final year of
                    track eligibility as a first year law student at Vanderbilt, where he broke the school record in the
                    steeplechase. Jerry’s running “career” was cut short by injury, which prompted him to take up the
                    noble
                    art of coaching.</p>

                <p>Because Jerry subscribes to the proposition that the coach gets full credit for
                    all successes (and its
                    corollary that the coach takes no blame for any failures), he is quick to take credit for the
                    excellent
                    results achieved by GRC men on his watch including the men's 8th place finish at the 2017 USATF Club
                    Cross Country Championship and the 1st place in the 2018 Millrose Games Distance Medley Relay.</p>

                <p>Jerry also claims full credit for the transformation of the GRC’s women’s team
                    into a burgeoning national
                    power, which was amply demonstrated by the team’s outstanding 6th place finish in the 2016 USATF
                    Club
                    Cross Country Championships, and victory in the Distance Medley Relay at the 2017 Millrose Games.

                <p>Before he started working with post-graduate athletes, Jerry was a college coach
                    in the DC area. When
                    Jerry became Head Coach at the University of the District of Columbia in 1995, he inherited a
                    program
                    that was in complete disarray. In his two years at UDC, Jerry recruited and coached an athlete who
                    qualified for Division II nationals in the 800 and 1500 in indoor and outdoor track, but his
                    rebuilding
                    project was cut short when budget problems led to the suspension of the athletic department. Jerry
                    moved
                    to American University where he was Assistant Coach for seven years, during which time he recruited
                    and
                    coached All-Americans Sean O’Brien, Sean Duffy, and Samia Akbar.</p>

                <p>Jerry also coaches the Northern Virginia Running Club, a community-based team
                    where he has worked with
                    numerous standout women distance runners, including Jessica McGuire, who qualified for the 2020
                    Olympic
                    Trials Marathon with a huge PR of 2:43:55, former LaSalle All-American Kathy Liever, and Martha
                    Merz,
                    who broke the 17 year-old American Record for 10,000 meters for runners over 45 years-old at the
                    2008
                    Penn Relays.</p>

                <p>Jerry lives in Bethesda with his wife Michelle, who only runs when she’s chasing
                    their son Jacob. When
                    he’s not devising new and unique ways to whip his runners into shape, Jerry is a Trial Attorney with
                    the
                    United States Department of Justice.</p>
