                        <p>​Ian grew up in central Indiana and took up cross country and track in high school. While
                            lacking any noteworthy personal triumphs, he became enamored with the team atmosphere of
                            running and the success of the overall group. After high school, Ian attended Indiana
                            University where he carried his competitive focus from running over to cycling, and spent
                            the next six years competing with the IU Cycling Club, and an Indianapolis club team after
                            graduation.</p>
                        <p>When looking for a new challenge in fall of 2011, Ian ran the Indianapolis Monumental
                            Marathon in 3:12. He immediately fell in love with the marathon and decided to get more
                            serious about training. In the five years since, Ian has dropped his PR to 2:36 while
                            competing in some of the world’s biggest marathons in Boston, New York, Chicago and Berlin.
                        </p>
                        <p>​After years of solo training, Ian moved to the D.C. area looking for a training group to
                            both recapture the team atmosphere he missed from his early running days and to also push
                            him to another level in training. Ian joins GRC looking to see how he can continue to
                            improve on his times and contribute to the team. Ian works as a CPA within the Accenture
                            accounting advisory group in Arlington. </p>
