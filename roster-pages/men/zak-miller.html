                        <p>Zak was originally convinced to start running his freshman year of high school after numerous
                            arm injuries derailed what he'd like to think was a once-promising baseball career. Running
                            for Nick Baker at Haddonfield Memorial High School in New Jersey ended up being a
                            life-changing decision.</p>
                        <p>After a successful high school career, he moved on to run for Kutztown University, before
                            leaving the team and eventually the school after a couple of years. After years off from
                            running entirely, he was coerced into doing a local 5K and won, while finding himself almost
                            as fast as he had been back in peak-shape despite being supremely out-of-shape.</p>
                        <p>Newly inspired, he trained all summer for the 2013 Philadelphia Marathon and debuted at the
                            distance with a 2:41:51, and followed that up with a 2:36:02 at the 2014 Marine Corps
                            Marathon. Itching to set some new PRs across the board and some fast guys to train with and
                            a team to be a part of, he joined GRC at the beginning of 2015.</p>
                        <p>Zak has managed running stores for the last few years, most recently the Georgetown Running
                            Company, before deciding to head back to school full-time in 2015 at the University of
                            Maryland to finish up his psychology degree. At any given time, he'd probably rather being
                            watching an Orioles game with a beer.</p>
