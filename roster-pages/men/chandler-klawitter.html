                        <p>Chandler grew up in a family of runners, and watched his mother, grandmother, and great
                            uncles run Grandma’s Marathon in his native Minnesota every June, and his brothers compete
                            in track and cross country. Chandler started running around his neighborhood at a young age,
                            and joined the cross country team in 6th grade. He continued running competitively after
                            high school as a member of the track and cross country team at South Dakota State
                            University. Upon graduation Chandler served as Peace Corps Volunteer in rural Panama, and
                            moved to DC in August 2020, the midst of the pandemic, to start in the EPA’s Office of
                            Ground Water and Drinking Water as a GIS and data analyst.</p>
