                        <p>Like many distance runners, Jordan defected from the soccer field in high school, finding his
                            home on the track and on the cross country course at Poolesville High School in Maryland.
                            Jordan's career at UMBC was a series of highs and lows as he spent time during his 5-year
                            stint competing for both the running club and the varsity squad, battling serious illnesses
                            and injuries.</p>
                        <p>â€‹While working towards earning a Master's Degree during his 5th year, his persistence and
                            dedication to the sport seemingly began to pay off. Jordan ran PR's in 3 events during the
                            cross country and indoor track seasons, including lowering his 5k pr by 42 seconds over the
                            course of 4 weeks. However, a serious injury cut short his collegiate career, leading to
                            Jordan undergoing reconstructive core surgery the day after graduation.</p>
                        <p>With GRC, Jordan is racing at a variety of distances on the roads. Jordan lives and works in
                            Northern Virginia.</p>
