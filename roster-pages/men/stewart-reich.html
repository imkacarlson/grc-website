                        <p>Stewart started running in his junior year of high school after realizing that his future was
                            not in football or lacrosse, and he was not an overnight sensation, as her ran on the JV
                            squad for all but two races that first year. After silencing the doubters and breaking
                            through to varsity as a high school senior, Stewart ran at Goldey-Beacom College, where he
                            was all conference in cross country his senior year. Despite the fact that track was a club
                            program, Stewart ran 3:58 for 1500 as a senior.</p>
                        <p>Since Stewart’s start with GRC, he has worked hard to keep his position on the team. Stewart
                            joined fresh out of college having only run a 5k in 15:48, and under the guidance of Coach
                            Jerry he has lowered that time to 14:30. During the 2017 spring track season, Stewart ran
                            his 10k pr of 29:46 in what some have called his only smartly-paced race ever. Stewart’s
                            goals for the 2018 track season are to finally break the magical 14:30 barrier in the 5k and
                            lower his time in the 10k (proving that this is his distance).</p>
                        <p>Additionally, Stewart is married to <a
