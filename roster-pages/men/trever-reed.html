                        <p>Trever started running as a sophomore in high school mainly to stay in shape for varsity
                            basketball. After 4 years of trying to juggle basketball and distance running, he made the
                            switch to running full time in the middle of his sophomore year at Miscercorida University,
                            after spending most of his freshman basketball season on the bench. During his college
                            career, Trever placed 4th in the conference in the 10,000, and 13th in the conference in
                            cross country, and was a 2 year captain, and a 2 time coaches' award winner.</p>
