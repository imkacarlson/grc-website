                        <p>Paul's first encounters with running would foreshadow his future success when he won age
                            group awards in his elementary school one mile fun runs. He would go on to compete all four
                            years of high school with his top performance coming at the Pennsylvania indoors state meet
                            where he finished 5th in 4:21. He also contributed to a 3rd place finish in the XC state
                            meet, 2nd and 3rd in the 4 x 800 indoors and outdoors, respectively, as well as the top DMR
                            time in the state. </p>
                        <p>At Susquehanna University, Paul was a big fish in a small pond, finishing first on his team
                            in virtually every race and ending his collegiate career as a 3-time NCAA qualifier in XC
                            and a 2-time All-American in track (indoors in the mile and outdoors in the steeple).</p>
                        <p>â€‹As a post-collegiate, Paul has continued to find success. On the track, he was the 2013 Penn
                            Relays Olympic Development steeple champion, anchored the GRC DMR to victory in the 2018
                            Millrose Games, and holds the club record in the steeplechase. On the roads, he was the 2013
                            Run for the Diamonds champion, 8th overall and 2nd American at Broad Street in 2017, and the
                            top local finisher at the 2018 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler. Paul is a teacher in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Paul was named GRC's 2018 MVP, which you can read about <a target="_blank"
