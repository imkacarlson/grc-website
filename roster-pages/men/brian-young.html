                        <p>After running for his high school track and cross country teams, Brian attended Miami
                            University in Ohio, where he played on the school’s Rugby Football club, which at the time
                            was nationally ranked. Following a series of traumatic injuries on the Rugby pitch, Brian
                            re-focused on running, for which he was both physically and temperamentally better suited.
                            Brian ran his first marathon in 2006 and has completed seven marathons to date. He has seen
                            substantial improvement under the tutelage of Coach Jerry Alexander and is presently
                            focusing on the marathon and half marathon. </p>
                        <p>His goals are to break into the mid-2:30 range in the marathon and to improve his 10k time.
                            Brian’s hobbies are following the U.S. National Soccer Team, vowing never to run another
                            marathon, and keeping up on current events. When he’s not pursuing PRs, Brian chases
                            corporate criminals at his job as a federal prosecutor with the Justice Department, where he
                            focuses on white collar crime and public corruption.</p>
