                        <p>Dave was a wrestler in high school who ran only to stay in shape. At age 30, Dave showed up
                            for his first ever track workout with the Northern Virginia Running Club, where he met <a
                                target="_blank" href="/grc-website/jerry.html">Coach
                                Jerry</a>. It took only a few workouts for Dave to become hooked by both the challenge
                            and the
                            social aspect of the group workouts, and it took only a few more workouts for Coach Jerry to
                            realize Dave had potential to be more than a casual jogger. Under Coach Jerry’s rigorous
                            scrutiny, Dave has developed into a top-caliber over 35-year-old runner, and has improved
                            dramatically since his promotion to the GRC Race Team. Dave proved he can hang with the
                            youngsters when, in his ever track race, he ran 15:30 for 5k at the Swarthmore Invitational.

                        <p>​Dave occupies his daylight hours by working as an environmental consultant in northern
                            Virginia and enjoys spending his free time with his wife, Caroline, who he happened to meet
                            at the track.</p>
