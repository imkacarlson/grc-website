                        <p>Elias started running in 8th grade when he realized he was terrible at basketball and bored
                            with baseball, and decided to follow in the footsteps of his father who ran at Boston
                            College. During his senior year of high school, Elias was ranked third in the country in the
                            indoor 800. Elias ran collegiately at Penn, where he was a member of the school
                            record-breaking DMRs indoor and outdoor, and scored at the Heps multiple times. With GRC,
                            Elias hopes to break 1:50 in the 800. Elias works as a management consultant for the federal
                            government.</p>
