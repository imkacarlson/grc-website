                        <p>Dylan grew up attempting to follow in the footsteps of fellow Kansans Jim Ryun and Billy
                            Mills, but, although he was a member of a Kansas 3A state champion cross country team, he
                            did not initially find individual success. After high school, Dylan left the Great Plains to
                            attend the University of Maryland where he joined UMD Club Running and eventually became
                            club president. Sidelined often due to chronic injury, he primarily acted as club coach
                            until he moved on to pursue his M.S. in Biotechnology degree at Georgetown University, where
                            he also ran on the club team. It was during graduate school where he caught his stride and
                            set significant personal records at the 2018 Cherry Blossom 10 Miler and in the 5k at the
                            2018 Kehoe Twilight Invitational. With GRC, Dylan aims to train smart with the support of
                            his teammates and Coach Jerry to set PRs across the board.</p>
