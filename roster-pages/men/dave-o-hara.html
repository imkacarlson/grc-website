                        <p>Raised in the coal country hills of western Pennsylvania Dave O’Hara begin his athletic
                            career as most good Pittsburghers do, playing football. When he (and the football and
                            basketball coaches were all in agreement) realized he was much better getting to the ball
                            before anyone else than actually doing anything with it, the seeds were planted. Having
                            grown up watching his big sister run track and cross country Dave decided to give it a shot.
                            Dave went on to run for the Mount Lebanon HS Blue Devils cross country team that finished
                            7th at states his senior year. He was also part of the WPIAL championship 4x800 meter relay
                            team.</p>
                        <p>​He continued to run in college while attending Slippery Rock University (not an online
                            school, it is a real place). While at THE ROCK, Dave progressed well in both cross country
                            and track becoming captain by his senior year. Dave coaches cross country and teachers in
                            Fairfax county. Now a Masters runner and father, Dave has his sites set on winning Masters
                            titles and helping to mentor new members balancing work and training. When not running or
                            coaching Dave enjoys spending time with his wife Laura O'Hara playing princess tea party
                            with his daughter, and watching the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
