                        <p>Jordan started running in 7th grade in his native New York because the high school coach was
                            the middle school gym teacher, and made the class run 800 meters every day before gym class.
                            Jordan went from running a 2:07 800m his freshmen year to 1:51 his junior year, and, as a
                            senior, ran on state championship 4 x 400m and 4 x 800m teams. During his career at Duke,
                            Jordan was an ACC finalist at 1500, and ran a leg on a DMR that ran 9:36. With GRC, Jordan
                            hopes to take a shot at the 4 minute mile barrier, and run some competitive 5000s. Jordan
                            works as a full stack software engineer developing and maintaining data analytics software.</p>
