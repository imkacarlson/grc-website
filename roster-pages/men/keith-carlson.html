                            Keith was introduced to running when his parents started training for the 2007 San Francisco
                            Marathon, and he biked alongside them. After Keith beat his Dad in a 2 mile race, he was
                            hooked. Keith ran four years of cross country in high school, and continued his career at
                            Willamette University. During his time at Willamette, Keith ran in four Division III
                            national meets, contributed to three conference team titles, and is 4th on Willamette's all
                            time 5000 list. Keith's goal with GRC is to keep the momentum going and run more PRs. Keith
                            is a graduate student at George Washington University focusing on Cybersecurity in Computer
                            Science.</p>
