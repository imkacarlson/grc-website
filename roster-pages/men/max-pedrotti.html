                        <p>​Max swore off running after his 6th grade track championships 1600 meters, where he was
                            disqualified – in the middle of the race – for blocking other runners with his intimidating
                            85 pound frame. After a year away from the sport, Max returned to track in 8th grade, and
                            then joined the Christian Brothers High School cross country and track teams, in Sacramento,
                            California. Making the varsity team as a sophomore, Max led the team for his final two years
                            and carried the team to the California State Championships in his senior year. On the track,
                            he was the first distance athlete from his high school to make it to the state qualifying
                            meet in over 10 years and the first male cross country athlete to be recruited to a NCAA
                            Division 1 program.</p>
                        <p>Max attended the University of San Diego, where he was a 4 year varsity runner in cross
                            country and track under the guidance of Coach Will Guarino. As a Torero, he set school
                            records in the 8,000 meters in cross country, and the 3,000, 5,000, and 10,000 meters on the
                            track. He received the most improved award his freshman year, and most valuable the
                            following three years.</p>
                        <p>​With GRC, Max wants to set a new PR in every event, then work his way up to the marathon.
                            Max currently works at on the Hill as a staffer for a U.S. Representative. </p>
