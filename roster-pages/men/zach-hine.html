                        <p>Zach started running his sophomore year of high school after an unsuccessful stint as a
                            soccer player. Zach continued his running career at Cornell University, where he won
                            multiple Ivy League championships, although he was denied his first title when he finished
                            second in the 10,000 meters in 2007 to future GRC teammate Sean Barrett. After graduating in
                            2009, Zach immediately moved up to the longer distances on the road, and ran his best
                            marathon at the 2012 Olympics Trials. Since then, Zach has lived all over the country and
                            raced all over the world, but has yet to break his marathon PR. Zach moved to the DC area in
                            the summer of 2019, and hopes that training with GRC will finally get him over that hump.
                            Zach currently lives in Kensington, MD, and works as an engineer.</p>
