                        <p>After jogging cross country in high school, Kieran re-discovered running as a senior in
                            college, goaded into running regularly by a group of friends from his dorm at Notre Dame.
                            Upon moving to New York, he was foolishly inspired by the 2009 NYC Marathon and made his
                            marathon debut at the same race in 2010. Unfortunately, he has since adopted the marathon as
                            his distance of choice, most successfully in the 2016 Olympic Trials. On a day where over a
                            third of the field wilted in hot conditions, Kieran logged an impressive 24th place finish
                            in 2:21:37.</p>
                        <p>Since joining GRC, Kieran has set too many PR's to count - and sometimes in practice! A
                            RunWashington piece published in February 2016 covers Kieran's meteoric improvement: <a

                                baby, 24th place Olympic Marathon Trials finish highlight O’Connor’s week</a></p>
                        <p>Moving forward, Kieran hopes to continue to turn heads with a long-term eye towards the 2020
                            Olympic Trials.</p>
