                        <p>Josh started running winter track his freshman year of high school to get in shape for
                            lacrosse, and began running cross country his junior year. Josh played lacrosse at Cabrini
                            College but walked on to the cross country team and ran his freshman and sophomore years. As
                            a post-collegiate, Josh has focused on longer races, and has run 15 ultra marathons, and
                            many trail races. Josh's goal with GRC is to explore his potential on the roads.</p>
