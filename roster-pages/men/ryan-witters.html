                        <p>Evansville, Indiana native Ryan Witters first stepped on the track in order to condition for
                            the upcoming high school soccer season and he quickly realized his affinity for long
                            distance races. After joining the high school cross country team as a Junior and several
                            city/conference/etc. titles later, Witters took his talents a few blocks down the road to
                            the University of Evansville. At Evansville, he lead the team to school best finishes at the
                            conference and regional championships. </p>
                        <p>Never one to be complacent, upon graduation Witters moved to Washington, DC to begin work as
                            a civil engineer and train with the East coast’s elite, such as GRC’s own Sam Luff and Jason
                            Myers. “Without quality and high class training partners, I would not be the runner that I
                            am today,” Witters claims. During his time with the GRC, Witters has lowered personal
                            records at every distance (800m to 10k), set the club record in the mile, coined the term
                            “Giddy Up” (which is overused and not credited by teammate Joe ‘Wiggy’ Wiegner), and was
                            mis-quoted as claiming responsibility for founding the GRC in 2011. </p>
