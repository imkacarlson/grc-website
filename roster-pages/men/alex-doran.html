                        <p>Alex started running in his native Seattle because he left his cleats at home the first day
                            of high school soccer tryouts. Alex studied mechanical engineering at Johns Hopkins
                            University, where he qualified for the 2019 NCAA D-III indoor championships in the 3000 and
                            set the school record in that event for 2 years, and competed in two NCAA XC championships.
                            Alex's goals with GRC are to improve his PRs, and try some events that he did not run in
                            college. Alex works as strategy consulting analyst Dean & Company in Northern Virginia.</p>
