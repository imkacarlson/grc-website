                        <p>Kyle successfully avoided racing any distance longer than the gym mile until his junior year
                            of high school when he joined the cross country team in his hometown of Edina, MN.
                            Encouraged by his potential in the sport and the unique and supportive community of distance
                            running, he continued competing at the Division III level for St. Olaf College. Though
                            injuries derailed his first two years of college running, Kyle kept at it, and his
                            consistency was rewarded with a strong senior season when he became won the Karhu Shoe Race
                            hosted by the cross town rivals, Carleton College, and earned All-Conference Honorable
                            Mention in the Indoor 5k. With a full head of hair and his future in front of him, he hopes
                            to gain a new perspective on life and running, continue to push his boundaries, and take a
                            brief respite from the Minnesota winters while working as a researcher in Washington, DC.
