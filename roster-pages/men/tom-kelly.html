                        <p>Tom was born in DC and first caught the running bug chasing his dad around the Sidwell track
                            in middle school, often on days when he wasn't playing his favorite childhood sport,
                            baseball, with his younger brother Devin.</p>
                        <p>By the time he started at Gonzaga High School, he was running year round. He then ran
                            collegiately at Fordham University in the Bronx. Tom recovered from injuries his junior and
                            senior year, and ran the 1200 leg on Fordham's DMR that finished 4th at the Atlantic 10
                            Indoor Championships. He also ran the 1200 leg and split 3:05 on Fordham's DMR at the IC4A
                            Indoor Championships.</p>
                        <p>After joining GRC in 2013, he began his goal to develop as a distance runner. Since then he
                            has set personal bests in distances ranging from 1 mile to a half marathon. He attributes
                            this success to the weekly workouts with teammates and Coach Jerry.</p>
                        <p>Tom lives in Washington DC and works as a tax accountant at Riibner & Associates in
                            Kensington. He also is an assistant cross country coach at Gonzaga High School.</p>
