                        <p>Lukasz started running in middle school because all his friends were doing it, and by his
                            sophomore year of high school he had fully devoted himself to running and never looked back.
                            Luk had a successful high school career, running the second fastest 800 in the state of
                            Pennsylvania his senior year, and with his twin brother Greg, won the 4 x 800 state title.
                            At Franklin & Marshall College, he and Greg won four outdoor Centennial Conference 4 x 800
                            titles and an indoor DMR, set 3 school records in relays, and Luk set the school record in
                            the 800 outdoors. Luk’s goal is to improve his PRs at 800 and 1500, and try his hand at
                            longer distances on the track. Luk is currently pursuing a PhD in Biochemistry at the
                            University of Maryland, College Park.</p>
