                        <p>Tyler started running cross-country his senior year of high school, and after he experienced
                            some success, he dropped his longtime childhood sports of baseball and basketball. Tyler ran
                            cross-country and track at Philadelphia University, where he captained both teams, and
                            pursued his degree in architecture. Though he never ran what he considers to be spectacular
                            times in college, Tyler prides himself on being able to balance the rigors of both the
                            architecture and athletic programs. Tyler was an academic All-American his junior year, and
                            was awarded the Philadelphia University President’s Award, given to the student-athlete who
                            best excels in the classroom and the playing field. Since college, Tyler has focused on the
                            marathon, dropping his PR from 2:53 to 2:33. After a few years of training solo, Tyler is
                            looking forward to competing for and contributing to GRC, and hopes to run PRs in every
                            distance from the 5K to the Marathon. Tyler works as an architect in Clarendon, Virginia for
                            HDR Architecture, where he focuses on large Healthcare and Science and Technology projects."
