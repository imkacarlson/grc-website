                        <p>Originally from Concord, Massachusetts, Brian discovered running his freshman year of high
                            school. Following a four-year delusion that he was an 800 runner, he walked onto the team at
                            Middlebury College in 2013 only after one of the coach's prized recruits chose to attend a
                            rival school, opening up a spot on the roster. At Middlebury, he notched two all New England
                            cross-country performances and served as captain of the cross-country team his senior year.
                            Following graduation in 2017, Brian spent the summer interning in DC, where he discovered
                            his love for Beach Drive. While work took him back to New England that fall, he vowed to
                            return. After a brief stint coaching track and teaching history at his former high school,
                            Brian moved back to DC in 2019 in order to be reunited with Rock Creek Park. After a summer
                            of lonely runs, he got in touch with Coach Jerry and the GRC crew and joined up in February
                            2020. Under Coach Jerry's guidance, he hopes to improve his times in the 5000, 10,000, and
                            just maybe the half marathon.</p>
