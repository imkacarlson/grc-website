                        <p>Evan began running in sophomore year of high school when his hopes and dreams of making it as
                            an NBA sharpshooter were dashed by his sub-6 foot height. Though he enjoyed moderate success
                            in the sport, he took several years off from running in college before rediscovering it in
                            2015. Prior to joining GRC, Evan spent five years running for Coach Jerry with Northern
                            Virginia Running Club, where he set PRs across every distance. A traumatic brain injury Evan
                            suffered while running in November 2019 has ironically provided him a greater appreciation
                            for the sport, and he hopes to tap into his potential training with GRC. Evan hopes to break
                            2:30 in the marathon as a member of GRC while gaining some PRs in the shorter distances
                            along the way. By day, Evan is a financial journalist and master's student at Johns Hopkins
                            University. </p>
