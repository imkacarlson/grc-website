                        <p>Since childhood, Nina focused her athletic endeavors on soccer, while also playing tennis on
                            the side. At Dartmouth College, she opted for a fresh start and walked on to the women's
                            crew team. After a year and a half of competing, Nina realized that her athletic talents
                            could be better utilized elsewhere. Despite never having trained as a runner, she was able
                            to pull off an impressive showing at an indoor track meet on campus, convincing Dartmouth's
                            cross country coach that she merited a spot on the team. Nina only regretted not having
                            started running earlier, and was excited to continue to tap into her potential as a
                            post-collegiate athlete. She focused on the 5K and 10K initially, and eventually progressed
                            to longer distances. Nina is pursuing a Master's in Arab Studies at Georgetown's School of
                            Foreign Service.</p>
                        <p>On June 3, 2015, Nina was tragically killed in a house fire in Washington, DC. Nina will be
                            remembered for her infectious spirit, dedication to excellence in all aspects of her life,
                            and love of running.</p>
