                        <p>Kerry began running in middle school after unremarkable attempts at every other youth sport.
                            She had a successful prep career in Florida, winning the state title in the 3200 meters and
                            finishing second in the state in cross country, and ran for one year at Duke before taking a
                            5 year hiatus from serious running. Feeling shamed by her roommate's athletic pursuits,
                            Kerry ran her first marathon in Philadelphia in November 2011. The marathon rekindled her
                            love for competitive running and she ramped up her training and racing. Since joining GRC in
                            2013, Kerry has set PRs at distances from the 5k to marathon. With GRC, Kerry hopes to
                            continue to train hard and improve her times. When not running, Kerry works as a senior
                            policy advisor in the United States Senate.</p>
